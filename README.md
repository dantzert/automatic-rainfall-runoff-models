Interpretable rainfall-runoff models automatically from data. Submitted to Water Resources Research January 2023

Abstract:
As sensor networks expand in scale and modality, watershed data is increasingly available. However, the expert time needed to integrate this raw data into interpretable process-based models is not increasing at the same pace, if at all. Machine learning approaches are automated, but their lack of interpretability inhibits trust and insight. We present a method combining unit hydrographs and differential equation discovery that creates interpretable and computationally efficient models automatically. The method is used to predict rainfall response in synthetic and real catchments. This parsimonious representation of watershed dynamics provides theoretical insight as well as the computational efficiency to enable predictions across large sensor networks.
